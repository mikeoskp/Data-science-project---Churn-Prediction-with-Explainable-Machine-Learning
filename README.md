# Churn Prediction with Explainable Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Objective
Predict customer churn using machine learning and identify **key business drivers behind churn** using explainable AI techniques.

This project simulates a real-world **telecom / SaaS churn problem**, commonly used by companies in the USA and Canada.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- SQL-ready data modeling
- Scikit-learn
- SHAP (Explainable AI)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 📊 Dataset
Telecom customer dataset with:
- Tenure
- Monthly & total charges
- Contract type
- Internet service
- Payment method
- Support services
- Churn flag

---

## 🔍 Key Analyses
- Churn rate calculation
- Contract-based churn analysis
- Pricing impact on churn
- Tenure vs churn behavior
- Service-level churn comparison

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest Classifier (final model)

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Precision / Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC

---

## 🧠 Explainability
- SHAP used to interpret model predictions
- Feature-level churn drivers identified
- Business-friendly interpretation of ML outputs

---

## 📌 Key Insights
- Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn
- Fiber internet users churn more without tech support
- High monthly charges increase churn probability
- Short-tenure customers are most vulnerable

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Offer long-term contracts with incentives
- Provide proactive tech support to fiber users
- Target high-risk customers with retention campaigns

---

## 🚀 Outcome
This project demonstrates:
- Strong ML fundamentals
- Business-focused analytics
- Explainable AI skills
- Production-ready modeling approach
